    <h2>Certifications of Diploma in Technical Vocational Livelihood Track Electrical Installation And Maintenance Strand</h2>
    <ul class="diploma-list">
        <p>Pursuing the TVL Electrical Installation and Maintenance Strand at Zumarraga National High School provided me with both 
          theoretical knowledge and practical skills. This course was designed to develop competencies in electrical wiring
          installation, maintenance, and troubleshooting. It gave me hands-on experience in dealing with real-world electrical 
          systems, which was both challenging and rewarding. </p>
          <h2>Zumarraga National High School's Contribution:</h2>
          <p>Zumarraga National High School offered a nurturing environment with experienced mentors who were dedicated to their craft. Their guidance and support ensured that I not only met the 
            technical requirements but also developed as a well-rounded individual ready for the workforce.</p>
