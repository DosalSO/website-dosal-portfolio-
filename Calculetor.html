        <h3>Meaning of the Project</h3>
        <p>
          A calculator application is a software program that mimics the functionality of a physical calculator, enabling users to perform mathematical operations through a user interface. 
        </p>
        <p>In the context of programming, building such an application is more than just replicating calculationsâ€”it is a practical way to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Learn Programming Basics:</strong> Understand fundamental concepts like variables, data types, and operators.</li>
          <li><strong>Practice User Interface Design:</strong> Create an interactive graphical interface using Visual Studio.</li>
          <li><strong>Implement Logic:</strong> Write and test code to perform mathematical calculations.</li>
          <li><strong>Experience Problem Solving:</strong> Troubleshoot and debug issues during development.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <!-- Explanation of Concepts and Tools -->
      <div class="timeline-item">
        <h3>Explanation of Concepts and Tools</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Programming Language (C#):</strong> 
            <p>C# is a modern, object-oriented language developed by Microsoft. It is ideal for building desktop applications like calculators.</p>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Integrated Development Environment (IDE):</strong> 
            <p>Visual Studio provides a robust environment for coding, debugging, and designing the calculator's user interface.</p>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Graphical User Interface (GUI):</strong> 
            <p>Use GUI components such as buttons (for digits and operations), textboxes (to display input and results), and forms (to contain all elements).</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="timeline-item">
        <h3>Steps in Creating a Calculator</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Design:</strong> Use Visual Studio's toolbox to add controls like buttons and textboxes onto a form.</li>
          <li><strong>Code the Logic:</strong> Write C# code to handle user inputs, perform arithmetic operations, and display results.</li>
          <li><strong>Test:</strong> Ensure the application works correctly, handling errors such as dividing by zero or invalid inputs.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <!-- Educational Benefits -->
      <div class="timeline-item">
        <h3>Educational Benefits</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Understand Event-Driven Programming:</strong> Learn how user actions trigger specific events (e.g., button clicks).</li>
          <li><strong>Logic Development:</strong> Practice writing efficient and reusable code for calculations.</li>
          <li><strong>Debugging Skills:</strong> Improve your ability to identify and resolve errors in your program.</li>
          <li><strong>Creativity:</strong> Add advanced features like scientific calculations, memory functions, or enhanced styling.</li>
        </ul>
